Details to spice up your bathroom.  

## Accents

### Quick List
* Ground clutter:
  * Plants
  * Candles
  * Paintings
  * Bathrom Items (Towels, Toiletries, etc)
* Chairs, benches and stools

### Ground Clutter
It might sound weird, but putting small groupings of plants, candles, and whatever else on the floor is a nice way to add detail to your bathrooms. It'd be impractical in real life, but your sims don't mind. This would fit especially well in a BoHo-styled bathroom, or a modern Brownstone-type apartment - think young Sims with cluttered homes. 

{% include gallery caption="Ground clutter fills out empty space and says something about the Sim living there; an avid gardener or a BoHo Sim might plants in every room of their house." %}

Chairs and benches can make your bathroom look more luxurious. Or you can put a stool in your walk-in shower to make it look more lived in.

## Showers & Baths
### Quick List
* Walk-in Showers
  * Small 1x2 with open front
  * Large sunken shower with columns
  * Corner shower with glass walls
  * Raised shower with stairs and glass walls
  * Walk-in shower behind an archway
  * Use sunken platforms to delineate open showers
* Bath tubs
  * Place a corner tub on a platform with half-walls
  * Inset a bathtub into a 1x2 space in the wall
  * Raise a bathtub on a 1x2 platform
* Accents
  * Walk-in showers
    * Plant wall
    * Toiletries on floor
    * Bench/Side table in corner
  * Bathtubs
  * Place plants/candles around edge of tub
  * Put bathtub in front of big windows

You can make walk in showers using **Almost InvisiShower 2.0** (University) or **Steamy Times Shower** (Snowy Escape). Walk-in showers can be combined with platforms to make a clear delineation between the shower part of the room and the rest of the room. 

Walk-in showers also allow you space to put plenty of decor into the shower itself. Some ideas that I used in the builds you can see below:
* A small shower with glass walls on the sides
