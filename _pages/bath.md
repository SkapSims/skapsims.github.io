## 1 Random suggestions
* Use double sinks in master bathrooms
* Place bathtubs in front of big windows to give them a view :)
* **Robe of the Believer Wall Hook** is a bathrobe clutter item that I always forget to use
* Accent walls behind bathtubs/showers to give a bit more detail 
* Shelves over sinks with clutter
* Small side table with some magazines/books

## 2 Accents

### 2.1 Ground Clutter

Put plants, candles, paintings, and whatever else on the floor to fill out empty space. 

{% include gallery caption="Ground clutter fills out empty space and says something about the Sim living there; an avid gardener or a BoHo Sim might plants in every room of their house." %}

### 2.2 Chairs, stools & benches

Chairs and benches can make your bathroom look more luxurious. Or you can put a stool in your walk-in shower to make it look more lived in. 

{% include gallery id="g2.2" caption="Chairs, benches and stools can characterise your room. A wealthy sim might have a large bathroom with comfortable seating. A sim with mobility issues might use a stool in the shower." %}

## 3 Walk-in showers

You can make walk in showers using **Almost InvisiShower 2.0** (University) or **Steamy Times Shower** (Snowy Escape). Walk-in showers can be combined with platforms to make a clear delineation between the shower part of the room and the rest of the room. Walk-in showers also allow you space to put plenty of decor into the shower itself. There's a ton of different ways to build them and I included some examples below.

### 3.1 Small, open faced walk-in shower

I got the inspiration for this from ![img](/assets/img/emoji/yt.png)[honeybella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5_5O8quW5I) in their brownstone build. A simple 2x1 shower seperated from the rest of the room by **Illusion of Fence**. It's hard to make a walk-in shower more simple than this. 

{% include gallery id="g3.1" caption="A small walk-in shower inspired by honeybella." %}

### 3.2 Walk-in-shower built into an inset

I got the inspiration for this from [PlaneDot on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/ounumm/i_just_learned_how_to_make_a_walk_in_shower_and/). This is a 2x1 shower recessed into the wall. 

{% include gallery id="g3.2" caption="Walk-in shower recessed into a wall inset." %}

### 3.3 Walk-in shower behind an archway

No clue where I got this idea from. This is a 3x1 shower recessed behind an archway. I felt like it fit in with a jungle theme, but you do you. 

{% include gallery id="g3.3" caption="3x1 shower recessed behind an archway." %}

### 3.4 Corner walk-in with plant wall

Still working on figuring out where I got this idea from. It's a corner shower with a diagonal entrance, with a glass wall on one side. There's a plant wall and some toiletries on the floor. 

{% include gallery id="g3.4" caption="Corner walk-in with plant wall." %}


### 3.5 Sunken shower with columns

I saw the idea for this type of shower in a ![img](/assets/img/emoji/yt.png)[video by MarsPlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-eJp7gp59E) and to me, it seemed like something you'd have in ancient baths, maybe near a pool. So that's how I built it, but as ever, you can do as you like.

{% include gallery id="g3.5" caption="Sunken shower surrounded by columns and spandrels." %}

### 3.6 Raised shower with stairs

Another idea from ![img](/assets/img/emoji/yt.png)[MarsPlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-eJp7gp59E), this shower is on a raised platform that's surrounded by glass walls and connected by stairs. 

{% include gallery id="g3.6" caption="Raised shower with stairs." %}


## 4 Bathtubs

You can raise bathtubs onto a platform or place them in an inset wall to seperate them from the rest of the room. You can put a corner bathtub onto a corner platform surrounded by half walls.

### 4.1 Platform tub

One of the simplest things you can do with a tub: put it on a 2x1 platform. I used Snowy Escape to theme this one. 

{% include gallery id="g4.1" caption="Tub on raised platform." %}

### 4.2 Corner bath on platform 
The **Triteia Luxury Corner Bath wit Jets** on a platform with half walls surrounding it. There's no actual "step", the thing that looks like a step is a platform trim. 

{% include gallery id="g4.2" caption="Corner bath on platform with half walls" %}

### 4.3 Bath inset into wall
Just another way to place your bath that adds a lil' depth to your build. 

{% include gallery id="g4.3" caption="Bath inset into wall nook" %}

### 4.4 Tub with high platform behind
No clue when it'd ever be relevant to use this, but this is a bath with a high 1-tile deep platform behind it. I have an idea that maybe it'd look good in a renovated church themed build? Who knows, it has potential though. You could put all sorts of stuff on the top platform - like a bunch of paintings leaning against the wall?

{% include gallery id="g4.4" caption="Bath with high platform behind" %}


## 5 Toilets

### 5.1 Dividers

You can use walls, half walls, or room dividers to give the toilet an area of privacy. 

{% include gallery id="g5.1" caption="Toilet behind a half wall" %}

### 5.2 Seperate rooms
No pics for this one because it's too hard to show, but I have two suggestions:
* Have your WC as an inner room within the larger bathroom, ideal for big luxury bathrooms
* Have your WC in a completely seperate room

Hear me out on the last one; in a lot of old houses, the bathroom was built as just a small room for a toilet. Back in the day you didn't necessarily have a built in permanent bathtub with plumbing, the tub was just something you brought out when necessary. When built in tubs became more common later on, they ended up being put into a different room than where the toilet was. I was once in a house in Austria where the bathtub was in the pantry! So if you have a house that's meant to be really old, or say a cottage or something, you could add some authenticity by making the WC completely separate.
