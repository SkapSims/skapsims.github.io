title: "Building Tips, Details, and Inspiration"
---

This is my collection of various build ideas that I've gathered over time. Basically I have (had) a bunch of screenshots, links to videos, text files, moodboards, and god knows what else, but this wasn't very useful for me when I was building a room and just wanted to get some quick ideas to make the room more interesting. Because of that, I had the idea to try and collect and organise all the ideas I come across in one place, as a sort of "database" of inspiration. The hope is that when I'm building, say, a bathroom, I can go on the bathroom page and just scroll through to find specific tips to add more detail and depth to my build. 

You're welcome to use these ideas too. And just to be clear: None, or at least very few, of these ideas are mine originally. Most of the things you'll find here were inspired by Sims creators. On the [`Resources`](/build/links) page you'll find links to many of the creators I use to get inspiration. In addition, I will link specific creators next to specific ideas when I know for sure that they were the one that inspired me. I haven't done this for all of the ideas here because for most of them either (a) I don't know who originally inspired me or (b) the idea is very generic and has been shared by many creators. If you see something on one of my pages that you're sure you know who the original creator was, feel free to [`contact me`](/contact) with a link to the original thing and I'll add a link here. 

Some other relevant information: 
*  All of the screenshots on this site were taken by me in game of things I built in game using no mods or CC. 
* All of these things were built on test lots just for the purposes of making screenshots, so none of them are at their maximum prettiness, they are made simply to illustrate an idea.
* All of these builds have been playtested. However, if you do come across something that doesn't work, please [`let me know`](/contact).
