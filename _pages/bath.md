Details to spice up your bathroom.  

## Accents

It might sound weird, but putting small groupings of plants, candles, and whatever else on the floor is a nice way to add detail to your bathrooms. It'd be impractical in real life, but your sims don't mind. This would fit especially well in a BoHo-styled bathroom, or a modern Brownstone-type apartment - think young Sims with cluttered homes. Below is just a few examples that I made hastily; you can surely incorporate these better.

Chairs and benches can make your bathroom look more luxurious. Or you can put a stool in your walk-in shower to make it look more lived in.

## Showers & Baths

You can make walk in showers using **Almost InvisiShower 2.0** (University) or **Steamy Times Shower** (Snowy Escape). Walk-in showers can be combined with platforms to make a clear delineation between the shower part of the room and the rest of the room. 

As you can see in a lot of these screenshots, walk-in showers allow space to put plenty of decor into the shower itself.
