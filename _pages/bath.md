## General/Misc Suggestions
* Double sinks in master bathrooms
* Don't forget clutter items like **Robe of the Believer Wall Hook**
* Place bathtubs in front of big windows

## Accents

It might sound weird, but putting small groupings of plants, candles, and whatever else on the floor is a nice way to add detail to your bathrooms. It'd be impractical in real life, but your sims don't mind. This would fit especially well in a BoHo-styled bathroom, or a modern Brownstone-type apartment - think young Sims with cluttered homes. 

{% include gallery caption="Ground clutter fills out empty space and says something about the Sim living there; an avid gardener or a BoHo Sim might plants in every room of their house." %}

Chairs and benches can make your bathroom look more luxurious. Or you can put a stool in your walk-in shower to make it look more lived in. 

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption="Chairs, benches and stools can characterise your room. A wealthy sim might have a large bathroom with comfortable seating. A sim with mobility issues might use a stool in the shower." %}

## Walk-in showers

You can make walk in showers using **Almost InvisiShower 2.0** (University) or **Steamy Times Shower** (Snowy Escape). Walk-in showers can be combined with platforms to make a clear delineation between the shower part of the room and the rest of the room. Walk-in showers also allow you space to put plenty of decor into the shower itself. In the gallery below you can see different types of walk-in showers.

## Bathtubs

You can raise bathtubs onto a platform or place them in an inset wall to seperate them from the rest of the room. You can put a corner bathtub onto a corner platform surrounded by half walls.

{% include gallery id="gallery6" caption="Left: Corner tub on raised platform with half walls. Middle: Tub placed into a nook in the wall. Right: A raised platform behind the bath to create a kind of windowsill." %}

## Toilets
* Put the toilet behind a divider, using either a wall, a half-wall, or a divider object
* In a luxury bathroom, you can put the WC in a seperate room *within* the larger bathroom
* Older homes often had the toilet in a small room of its own; back in the day houses didn't necessarily have a room with a bathtub in it (the bathtub was something that was brought out when necessary). In an old house, like a cottage, try having your WC seperately from the main bathroom for a bit of authenticity.
