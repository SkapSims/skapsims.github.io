**WIP**

## 1 Beds

### 1.1 Loft bed

You can make a loft bed with a raised platform and a ladder. This can be a nice detail in a kid's room but can work for adult's rooms too in, say, an apartment. 

{% include gallery caption="Loft bed" %}

### 1.2 Four Poster Bed

This four poster bed is made using a platform, stairs, and columns. The curtains were placed with the `bb.moveobjects on` cheat.

{% include gallery id="g1.2" caption="A four-poster bed." %}

### 1.3 Surrounded by built in cabinets

Give your bed a more built-in feel by surrounding it with cabinets. This particular screenshot was inspired by [melapples](https://www.thesimsresource.com/downloads/details/category/sims4-lots-residential/title/amanda-no-cc/id/1505501/). Using **Unfulfilled Wall Sign** and **Private Wall** as the headboards.

### 1.4 Surrounded by shelves

Instead of just using cabinets, you could use shelves. 

### 1.5 Sunken bed??

## 2 Closets

There's tons of ways to do closets. Here are some of them.

### 2.1 Closet through archway

This is a 3x1 room connected to the bedroom via an archway. It provides a closet that is a bit more immersive than the in-game closets without taking up a ton of space.

### 2.3 L-shaped dresser area

### 2.4 2x4 Closets




## 3 Accents
* Put a bench/loveseat at the foot of the bed to give a more luxurious/comfy vibe
